# FoodSpector
FoodSpector is an application to see the health and safety data on restaurants in Chicago.

We get our data from the City of Chicago through an API.

We provide visual tools to view and interact with this data.

This is a fork of https://github.com/emmaamobi/Foodspector

### What's the difference between this and the fork?

* I like the aesthetics of my version far better
* I'm gonna maintain and host the project since I think it's cool


### TODO:
* View the violations separately 
* Fix the map bugs so users can see the restaurants 
* Fix/Redo searches for addresses and Zip Code.  
* Improve result algorithm
